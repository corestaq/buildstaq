config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_HOSTNAME
	string "System hostname"
	default "corestaq"
	help
	  Select system hostname to be stored in /etc/hostname.

	  Leave empty to not create /etc/hostname, or to keep the
	  one from a custom skeleton.

config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ISSUE
	string "System banner"
	default "Welcome to Open Corestaq"
	help
	  Select system banner (/etc/issue) to be displayed at login.

	  Leave empty to not create /etc/issue, or to keep the
	  one from a custom skeleton.

config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ROOT_PASSWD
	string "Root password"
	default ""
	depends on BR2_TARGET_ENABLE_ROOT_LOGIN
	help
	  Set the initial root password.

	  If set to empty (the default), then no root password will be
	  set, and root will need no password to log in.

	  If the password starts with any of $1$, $5$ or $6$, it is
	  considered to be already crypt-encoded with respectively md5,
	  sha256 or sha512.  Any other value is taken to be a clear-text
	  value, and is crypt-encoded as per the "Passwords encoding"
	  scheme, above.

	  Note: "$" signs in the hashed password must be doubled. For
	  example, if the hashed password is
	  "$1$longsalt$v35DIIeMo4yUfI23yditq0", then you must enter it
	  as "$$1$$longsalt$$v35DIIeMo4yUfI23yditq0" (this is necessary
	  otherwise make would attempt to interpret the $ as a variable
	  expansion).

	  WARNING! WARNING!
	  The password appears as-is in the .config file, and may appear
	  in the build log! Avoid using a valuable password if either
	  the .config file or the build log may be distributed, or at
	  the very least use a strong cryptographic hash for your
	  password!

	  Enter here the name of the network interface (E.G. eth0) to
	  automatically configure through DHCP at bootup.

	  If left empty, no automatic DHCP requests will take place.

	  For more complicated network setups use an overlay to
	  overwrite /etc/network/interfaces or add a networkd
	  configuration file.

	help
	  Sets the system's default PATH. It is being used in
	  /etc/profile in the skeleton-init-common package and by some
	  daemons.

	  The default should work in most cases.

config BR2_ENABLE_LOCALE_PURGE

config BR2_ENABLE_LOCALE_WHITELIST
	string "Locales to keep"
	default "C en_GB.UTF8"
	depends on BR2_ENABLE_LOCALE_PURGE
	help
	  Whitespace seperated list of locales to allow on target.
	  Locales not listed here will be removed from the target.
	  See 'locale -a' on your host for a list of locales available
	  on your build host, or have a look in /usr/share/locale in
	  the target file system for available locales.

	  Notice that listing a locale here doesn't guarantee that it
	  will be available on the target - That purely depends on the
	  support for that locale in the selected packages.

	  Generate support for a list of locales. Locales can be
	  specified with or without encoding, when no encoding is
	  specified, UTF-8 is assumed. Examples of locales: en_US,
	  fr_FR.UTF-8.

	  Space-separated list of time zones to compile.

	  The value "default" includes all commonly used time zones.
	  Note that this set consumes around 5.5M for glibc and 2.1M for
	  uClibc.

	  The full list is the list of files in the time zone database
	  source, not including the build and .tab files.

config BR2_TARGET_LOCALTIME

	  The time zone to install as the default local time, expressed

	    GMT
	    Europe/Paris
	    America/New_York

config BR2_ROOTFS_USERS_TABLES
	string "Path to the users tables"
	help
	  Specify a space-separated list of users table locations,
	  that will be passed to the mkusers utility to create
	  users on the system, with home directory, password, etc.

	  See manual for details on the usage and syntax of these files.

config BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY
	string "Filesystem overlay directories"
	default ""
	help
	  Specify a list of directories that are copied over the target
	  root filesystem after the build has finished and before it is
	  packed into the selected filesystem images.

	  They are copied as-is into the rootfs, excluding files ending
	  with ~ and .git, .svn and .hg directories.
